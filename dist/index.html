                    As I go through the different parts of that website, I have never been more confused. My experience was tapping other options rather than the option that I want. It took me time to find where to tap when choosing an option to view. The detailed page was good enough for me to understand and view the description and other information of the items but only a little of it while the home page is too messy to navigate easily.

                    The content was very confusing, but with the help of the images, I can distinguish the different types of items that was presented by the website. Other description is piling on another image, the other parts of the text is merged with another text, including other links. Therefore, I can't read it properly. I can only process a small amount of information because of the familiar words and images.

                    The grid has no consistent spaces, sizes, or positions. It is not responsive. There is no proper organization of the grid layout. It is not easy to navigate, especially if you don't have any idea of what are the contents. The layout is also very old and it doesn't adapt to the modernized way of this generation.
